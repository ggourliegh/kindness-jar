## 📊 DATA CALCULATIONS

### Streak Algorithm
```
Start with today
Look back one day at a time
If act exists on that day: streak++
If no act: break
Return streak count
```

**Example:**
```
Today (Jan 25): ✓ Act done
Yesterday (Jan 24): ✓ Act done  
Jan 23: ✓ Act done
Jan 22: ✗ No act
Result: 3-day streak
```

### Average Calculation
```
Total Acts ÷ Active Days
```

**Example:**
```
127 total acts
40 days with at least one act
127 ÷ 40 = 3.175 ≈ 3.2 per day
```

### Category Percentage
```
(Category Count ÷ Max Category Count) × 100
```

**Example:**
```
Partner: 25 acts
Mother: 22 acts (highest = 25)
Bar width: (22 ÷ 25) × 100 = 88%
```
