## 🎯 THE CONCEPT

### How It Works
1. User sees 10 beautifully designed jars on a shelf
2. Each jar represents a kindness category (Partner, Mother, Family, etc.)
3. User taps a jar → Jar wiggles with animation
4. Note card appears with specific kindness act
5. User can complete it, get another, or generate new AI task
6. Completion triggers celebration (100-piece confetti!)
7. Progress tracked: streaks, totals, categories

### The 10 Categories
1. **Partner** 💕 - Romantic relationship
2. **Mother** 🌸 - Acts for mothers
3. **Father** 🛠️ - Acts for fathers
4. **Family** 🏠 - Family bonding
5. **Friends** 🎉 - Friendship
6. **Colleagues** 💼 - Workplace kindness
7. **Strangers** 🌍 - Random acts
8. **Nature** 🌱 - Environmental care
9. **Pets** 🐾 - Animal love
10. **Self-Care** 💆 - Personal wellness
